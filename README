1. rake db:create

2. rake db:migrate

Most of the magic happens in the Harvest.rb model, but you need to set up your api credentials:

SUBDOMAIN        = yoursubdomain
ACCOUNT_EMAIL    = youremail
ACCOUNT_PASSWORD = yourpassword

I suggest you put them in an initializer called harvest_passwords.rb. This is already in the .gitignore file

There are rake tasks for populating the database with projects, people, and time entries.

rake harvest:get_projects

rake harvest:get_people

rake harvest:get hours

PENDING:
Project is wheneverized but it is not entirely implemented. Also the generated cron is not running properly.
