1. rake db:create

2. rake db:migrate

Most of the magic happens in the Harvest.rb model.  

There are rake tasks for populating the database with projects, people, and time entries.

rake harvest:get_projects

rake harvest:get_people

rake harvest:get hours

PENDING:
Project is wheneverized but it is not entirely implemented. Also the generated cron is not running properly.
